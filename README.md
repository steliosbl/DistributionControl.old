# DistributionControl
DistributionControl is a simple platform for managing work that has to be distributed accross many physical or virtual machines. The 'work' executed is defined by the user, the only requirement being that it is a constantly running process.

DistributionControl offers advanced features such as load balancing accross machines (or 'nodes') with different processing capacity, as well as job redundancy.

As of 2017 a new version, completely re-written and with several improvements and new features, is in development.
